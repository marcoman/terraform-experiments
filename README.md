# Introduction
I find that I have to work over different examples of technologies again and again.  Traditionally, I have worked these repositories under somebody else's organization.  Here, I start to collect my experiements in my organization.

What binds these folders is they are about terraform.  When I follow an example from an online source, I'll document the process in code in the respective folder, and write up what I can, when I can.
